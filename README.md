## 📜 Notes 📜

- It was made for educational purposes.
- It is a crime to use it for malicious or attack purposes.
- It has been done for educational & testing purposes on one site.
- Since the site has a Captcha, you can easily use the code without any issues by purchasing a Captcha solver from [Captcha Monster](https://capmonster.cloud)
- Since the code is made for testing and educational purposes, I do not accept any responsibility for misuse.


# 🛠️ Installation 🛠️

`python adres-oto.py`

# ⛳ Usage ⛳

- There are some things you need to fill out & have before starting the code.
- Since the site has a Captcha, you can easily use the code without any issues by purchasing a Captcha solver from [Captcha Monster](https://capmonster.cloud)
- Only those providing the necessary service on the target site can use this code, as it requires a username and password. Enter the username and password into the adres-cookie.py file.
- For this, you will need the Turkish Citizenship Number (TC). You can use this information from your own identity provided by the Republic of Turkey.
- The API has access restrictions, meaning there is an IP address restriction system in place. Currently, only localhost (your own computer) is added. You can modify this within the code.
- After completing everything, meaning the cookie and captcha are resolved automatically, we can send a request to the API. You can send a request to the API as follows:
http://localhost/adres-v2.php?tc=
